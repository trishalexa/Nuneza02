<h2> WELCOME TO FLOWERSHOP</h2>
<h3>We offer different kind of flowers<h3>
<p>Rose <br> Rose, (genus Rosa), genus of some 100 species of perennial shrubs in the rose family (Rosaceae). Roses are native primarily to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Many roses are cultivated for their beautiful flowers, which range in colour from white through various tones of yellow and pink to dark crimson and maroon, and most have a delightful fragrance, which varies according to the variety and to climatic conditions.</p>
<p>Orchid <br> Orchid, (family Orchidaceae), any of nearly 1,000 genera and more than 25,000 species of attractively flowered plants distributed throughout the world, especially in wet tropics. Orchidaceae is a member of Asparagales, an order of monocotyledonous flowering plants that also includes the asparagus and iris families. The word orchid is derived from the Greek word (orchis) for testicle because of the shape of the root tubers in some species of the genus Orchis. These nonwoody perennial plants are generally terrestrial or epiphytic herbs (i.e., growing on other plants rather than rooted in soil). Those attached to other plants often are vinelike and have a spongy root covering called the velamen that absorbs water from the surrounding air. Most species manufacture their own food, but some live on dead organic material (saprotrophic) or are helped to obtain nourishment by a fungus living in their roots</p>
<p>Tulip <br> Tulip, (genus Tulipa), genus of about 100 species of bulbous herbs in the lily family (Liliaceae), native to Central Asia and Turkey. Tulips are among the most popular of all garden flowers, and numerous cultivars and varieties have been developed.</p>
